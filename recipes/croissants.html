        <h2>How to Make Stuffed Eggplant</h2>
       
        <ol>
         <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> cheesecake filling, lemon curd and lemon zest in a bowl; stir well. Add mixture to a piping bag or large zip-top bag. Make a small cut in the corner of the bag.</li>
         <li><strong>Step 2:</strong>Use a paring knife to make a small cut into the side of each croissant. Create an opening large enough to pipe the filling into. Fill each roll with about 3 tablespoons of  filling. Place filled croissants on a wire rack set inside a lined baking sheet to catch excess drippings. </li>
         <li><strong>Step 3:</strong>Add sugar and water to a small saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce to medium low and cook, without stirring, until lightly golden brown, about 10 minutes. Remove mixture from the heat. Working very carefully, pour sugar syrup evenly over prepared croissants to lightly coat rolls; let stand until completely cooled and lightly hardened on top, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
